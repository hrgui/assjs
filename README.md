# @hrgui/assjs

> [!NOTE]
> This is a modified version of https://github.com/weizhenye/ASS that attempts to try to make it work for older browsers!

# Planned Changes

- [ ] Make it TypeScript
- [ ] Make the API closer to jassub / libass-wasm, so it can be used interchangably
- [ ] Make it work in older browsers, minimum Chromium 47 - or at least figure out how far we can go back for better support across different types of devices
- [ ] Add a `disableAnimations` API
- [ ] Make it be able to distinguish between subtitles and signs

> [!WARNING]
> Under construction - API still not complete - but feel free to look at [ORIGINAL README](./ORIGINAL-README.md)
